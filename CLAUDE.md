## Workflow Orchestration

### 0. Agents & Context Efficiency - Subagent Discipline

#### General rule
**Context-aware delegation:**
 - Under ~50k context: prefer inline work for tasks under ~5 tool calls.
 - Over ~50k context: prefer subagents for self-contained tasks, even simple ones — the per-call token tax on large contexts adds up fast.

When using subagents, include output rules: "Final response under 2000 characters. List outcomes, not process."
Never call TaskOutput twice for the same subagent. If it times out, increase the timeout — don't re-read.

#### File Reading
Read files with purpose. Before reading a file, know what you're looking for.
Use Grep to locate relevant sections before reading entire large files.
Never re-read a file you've already read in this session.
For files over 500 lines, use offset/limit to read only the relevant section.

#### Responses
Don't echo back file contents you just read — the user can see them.
Don't narrate tool calls ("Let me read the file..." / "Now I'll edit..."). Just do it.
Keep explanations proportional to complexity. Simple changes need one sentence, not three paragraphs.

**Tables — STRICT RULES (apply everywhere, always):**
- Markdown tables: use minimum separator (`|-|-|`). Never pad with repeated hyphens (`|---|---|`).
- NEVER use box-drawing / ASCII-art tables with characters like `┌`, `┬`, `─`, `│`, `└`, `┘`, `├`, `┤`, `┼`. These are completely banned.
- No exceptions. Not for "clarity", not for alignment, not for terminal output.

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

### 7. Deployment
- Always ask before deploying to staging and/or production

## Task Management

1. **Task Structure** `tasks/todo.md` is the general project overview, `specs/` contains the breakdown of the features
2. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items, create a feature folder under specs/ and refer to in in todo.md
3. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
4. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
5. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
6. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
7. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
