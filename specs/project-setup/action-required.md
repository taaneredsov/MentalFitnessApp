# Action Required: Project Setup

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] **Verify .env.local exists with Airtable credentials** - Required for API layer to connect to Airtable

## During Implementation

- [ ] **Create PWA icons** - Replace placeholder icons with actual branded icons (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon 180x180). Can use tools like realfavicongenerator.net or create in design software.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Test PWA installation on real device** - Verify "Add to Home Screen" works on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] **Configure Vercel project** - Connect repository to Vercel for deployment (if not already done)
