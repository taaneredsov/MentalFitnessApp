No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

> **Testing Note:** To test the onboarding flow, create a user in Airtable with:
> - **No password hash** (`Paswoord Hash` field empty)
> - **No last login** (`Laatste login` field empty)
>
> Both fields must be empty for the user to be treated as a first-time user.
