# Action Required: Program Creation & Onboarding

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [x] **Verify Airtable automation exists** - Confirm the automation that populates "Mentale methode" based on goals/days is set up and working in Airtable
- [x] **Confirm duration options** - Verify the exact duration options available in the Airtable "Duur van programma" field (Single Select options)

## During Implementation

- [ ] **Test Airtable automation timing** - Determine how long the automation takes to run (affects polling interval and timeout settings)

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Test full flow with real Airtable data** - Create a program through the wizard and verify automation triggers correctly
