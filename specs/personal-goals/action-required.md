# Action Required: Personal Goals

Manual steps that must be completed by a human.

## Before Implementation

- [x] **Create Airtable tables** - Tables already created by user:
  - Personal Goals: `tblbjDv35B50ZKG9w`
  - Personal Goal Usage: `tbl8eJeQtMnIF5EJo`

- [ ] **Get Airtable field IDs** - Need to retrieve field IDs from Airtable for both tables to add to field-mappings.js

## During Implementation

None required - all implementation can be automated.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Test in production** - Verify feature works on deployed app after deployment
